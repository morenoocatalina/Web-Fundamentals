    <img src="images/Wireframe.jpeg" alt="home page wireframe" />

    <p>This is the wireframe for our Home page, which illustrates the layout and arrangement of elements on our main page. We are designing a welcoming and informative landing page to introduce visitors to our recycling initiatives and tips. It is more than anything a presentation of what we want to achieve, our goals and why we are doing this. We also want to demonstrate the importance of recycling and the impact it has, what good consequences are obtained from it and the bad consequences of not doing it.</p>

      <h3>Contact Us</h3>

    <p>On this page you will be able to contact us and talk to us for any questions, donations or any reason why you want to contact us. It is important that each company leaves its information and social networks where it can communicate because that expands the public more and also leaves a good image.</p>
