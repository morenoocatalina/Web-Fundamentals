    <h3>Recycling Tips</h3>

    <p>The recycling process covers a wide range of elements, each in different states and with specific requirements for their proper treatment. Paper and cardboard, for example, are commonly recycled materials in the form of packaging, boxes and newspapers. These elements, when collected, undergo decontamination and shredding processes to then become pulp, ready to be used in the manufacture of new paper products. Glass, another recyclable material, is collected and sorted by color before going through melting processes and forming new glass containers. As for metals, such as aluminum and steel, they are collected and melted at high temperatures to produce ingots that are used in the creation of new cans and metal products. Finally, plastics, with their different types identified by recycling codes, undergo classification and washing processes before being melted or converted into small flakes to be reused in the manufacture of a wide variety of products. In each phase of this process, from collection to transformation, we seek to maximize efficiency and minimize environmental impact, highlighting the importance of responsible management of resources and the promotion of a sustainable life cycle for materials.</p>
